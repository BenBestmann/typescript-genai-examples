Subject: Urgent - CloudSync Pro not syncing files since last update
Date: Wed, 4 Oct 2025 09:23:15 -0700
Message-ID: <abc123xyz@email.com>
Priority: High

Dear support team,

I'm writing to report a critical issue with CloudSync Pro (version 3.2.1) that started immediately after the update on October 2nd. The application is no longer syncing any of my files to the cloud storage, and I'm unable to access my documents from other devices.

Here are the specific problems I'm experiencing:

1. The sync icon keeps spinning indefinitely without completing
2. Error message appears: "Connection timeout - unable to reach CloudSync servers"
3. My last successful sync was on October 1st at 11:47 PM
4. I've tried restarting the application multiple times with no success
5. My internet connection is working fine with all other applications

This is severely impacting my work as I need to access these files for an important client presentation tomorrow morning. I have over 50GB of critical business documents that are now inaccessible from my laptop.

I've already tried:
- Restarting my computer
- Checking my firewall settings
- Verifying my subscription is still active (it is, expires Jan 2026)
- Uninstalling and reinstalling the application (same issue persists)

My system details:
- Operating System: macOS Sonoma 14.5
- CloudSync Pro Version: 3.2.1 (build 4521)
- Account email: john.smith@email.com
- Subscription tier: Professional Plan

Could you please help me resolve this issue as soon as possible? I would appreciate a response within 24 hours given the urgency of my situation.

Best regards,
